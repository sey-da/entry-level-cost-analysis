Entry Level Data Analytics Salary and Cost Comparison
This project analyzes and compares entry-level data analytics salaries and living costs across major developed cities worldwide. Using Python and pandas, it combines salary data and average monthly expenses like rent and food to calculate affordability ratios â€” such as rent and food costs as a percentage of entry-level salaries.

The goal is to help entry-level data analysts understand which cities offer the most sustainable and economical living conditions relative to their starting salaries.
